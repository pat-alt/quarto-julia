The [`quarto-julia` repo](https://github.com/pat-alt/quarto-julia) is a simple Quarto extension that makes a number of Julia-themed Custom Formats for Quarto available. 

On this website you can find a number of examples that demonstrate how the extension can be used and what kind of output it can produce. 

As you may have guessed from the design, this very website uses the `quarto-julia` extension.
