# A Julia Format for Quarto

## Installing

This extension makes a number of Custom Formats for Quarto available. Simply add this extension to your existing project as follows:

```zsh
quarto add pat-alt/quarto-julia
```

## Usage

You can find out more about this extension on this designated [website](https://www.paltmeyer.com/quarto-julia/). 

> By the way ... 

The website is actually hosted on this same repository. In particular, the `website/` folder contains a Quarto project that uses the extension in its parent folder (so the root folder). It builds the website in `docs/`, which itself is hosted on Github Pages.

## Developers

This extension is currently very simple and there is lots of scope for improvement also with respect to documentation on the website. I will occasionally contribute to this repo, as I use Quarto for my own work with Julia, but I don't have time to properly maintain it. Any contributions are more than welcome üôè
