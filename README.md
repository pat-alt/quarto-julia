> [!NOTE]

## Developers

This extension is currently very simple and there is lots of scope for improvement also with respect to documentation on the website. I will occasionally contribute to this repo, as I use Quarto for my own work with Julia, but I don't have time to maintain it very actively. Any contributions are more than welcome üôè
